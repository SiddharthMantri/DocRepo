Compressing
tar -zcvf {.tgz-file} {files}
tar -jcvf {.tbz2-file} {files}	

The GNU tar is archiving utility but it can be use to compressing large file(s). GNU tar supports both archive compressing through gzip and bzip2. If you have more than 2 files then it is recommended to use tar instead of gzip or bzip2.
-z: use gzip compress
-j: use bzip2 compress

tar -zcvf data.tgz *.doc
tar -zcvf pics.tar.gz *.jpg *.png
tar -jcvf data.tbz2 *.doc
ls -l

Decompressing
tar -zxvf {.tgz-file}
tar -jxvf {.tbz2-file}

unzipping of zip files
unzip <filename.zip>

Untar or decompressed a file(s) that is created using tar compressing through gzip and bzip2 filter

tar -zxvf data.tgz 
tar -zxvf pics.tar.gz *.jpg
tar -jxvf data.tbz2


FileSystem
Alt+Tab number  to switch to that tab.
Ctrl+Pageup     to switch to the next tab in forward direction
Ctrl+PageDown	to switch to the next tab in backward direction 
Alt+HOME  = for navigating directly to the home folder of the logged in user.


tail output the last part of files  

tail <options> <filename> Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. 

eg:

tail -f error.log
		output appended data as the file grows;

to check the number for directories inside a file..
ls -lR | grep ^d | wc -l

remove "R" if you dont want to look into subdirectories.
